The Flappy Bird AI repository contains a project that uses machine learning techniques to train an artificial intelligence to play the popular mobile game Flappy Bird. 
The project is written in Python and uses the PyGame library to simulate the game environment. 
The NEAT algorithm is used to develop and train the AI which plays the game in the best possible manner.
It learns playing the game through different generations.
After finding the best possible way it can continously play the game undefeatedly.
